# RaspiCamera

My professor <a href="http://utopia.duth.gr/~skontog/">Dr. Sotirios Kontogiannis</a> wanted to implement an android app  to control a Raspberry pi's server camera.

This sample project simulates the desired behavior with a simple WebView and direction buttons (for the camera) and a TextView that holds the latest camera movement status.

Note: The youtube video is used as a sample content of the WebView (as this will be replaced from the raspi camera's server streaming url). Thus, there isn't any actual exception handling implementation, according to the youtube video.

This is a sample screenshot of the app:
